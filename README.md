# 🌌 Galaxy Project

This repository showcases my journey of exploring, analyzing, and modeling galaxy datasets, including experiments with predictive models and generative approaches. 🚀

---

## 🗄️ Dataset

- **Galaxy Features (CSV)**: Obtained from the official **[Galaxy Zoo 2](https://data.galaxyzoo.org/)** dataset 🌌  
  - For consistent debiasing of the GZ2 question tree, the site strongly recommends the use of the **Hart et al. (2016) table**. ✅  
- **Galaxy Images**: ~200 images collected from **[Kaggle Galaxy Zoo 2 Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaimetrickz/galaxy-zoo-2-images)** 🖼️  
- Data has been carefully cleaned, preprocessed, and organized for analysis and modeling. ✨
- Additionally, i put the determinded data files that i worked on in this repository.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- **Jupyter Notebooks**:  
  - **Data Analysis**: Exploratory analysis with charts, visualizations, and insights 📈  
  - **Model Experiments**: Tried multiple predictive models for galaxy properties, including performance comparison of each model 💡  
  - **Conditional Autoencoder**: Initial experiments to generate new galaxy images using a conditional autoencoder 🪐  
    - **Note**: GPU memory limitations restricted training with larger batch sizes, so this part is a work in progress 🚧

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python   
- PyTorch
- Pandas & NumPy 
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 💡 Highlights & Challenges

- Carefully cleaned and processed galaxy datasets (images + CSV) ✨  
- Compared multiple predictive models with detailed analysis 📈  
- Explored generative approaches with a conditional autoencoder 🖼️  
- 🚧 **Challenge**: GPU limitations prevented training with large batch sizes or full-scale autoencoder models. Future work will continue on more powerful hardware💡

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Continue training the conditional autoencoder to generate high-quality synthetic galaxy images 🪐  
- Expand dataset and explore more advanced generative models

## 📝 Notes

This repository captures my learning journey and experiments with real astronomical data 🌟. It is intended to show the process, challenges, and insights gained, rather than just final results.
